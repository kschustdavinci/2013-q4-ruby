Appl is used to:
	create/modify customer records [parent & child]
		add attributes via selection lists + text entry
		mark customer record closed (reopen)
		associate specific services with a customer  [category + subcategory(ies)]
		maintain a history of changes
	create/modify associated devices
		add attributes via selection lists + text entry
		group devices
		mark device as decommissioned; dispose of device (reopen)
		maintain a history of changes
	generate on-line reports, including option to include HTML tags
	search capability + history (as links)
	
Embellishments:
